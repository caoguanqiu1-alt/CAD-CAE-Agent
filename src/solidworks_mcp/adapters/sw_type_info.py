"""
SolidWorks type-library introspection for robust COM method resolution.

Background: pywin32's late-binding (``CDispatch``) sometimes resolves SW
zero-argument methods (``GetType``, ``GetTitle``, ``GetPathName``,
``RevisionNumber`` …) as *properties* instead of methods. Calling them raises
``TypeError: 'int'/'str' object is not callable`` because the property getter
returns the value, and Python tries to call the value.

Fix: call ``CDispatch._FlagAsMethod(name)`` for each method name **that actually
belongs to the object's COM interface**. The calls tell pywin32 to resolve
``name`` via method invocation (IDispatch ``Invoke``), not property access.

This module:

1. Loads the makepy-generated wrapper for ``sldworks.tlb`` (``gen_py``).
2. Builds per-interface sets of method names (``ISldWorks``, ``IModelDoc2``,
   ``IAssemblyDoc``, ``IPartDoc``, ``IDrawingDoc`` …).
3. Exposes ``flag_methods(obj, *interfaces)`` to flag a dispatch in one shot.

Why per-interface rather than flagging everything: flagging an unknown name
triggers a COM ``GetIDsOfNames`` round-trip that fails with ``Unknown name.``.
Those round-trips are ~5 ms each; the full SW TLB has ~6 000 method names
across 482 interfaces, so a naive flag-everything approach costs ~30 s per
object. Per-interface flagging is ~1-3 s.

Fallback: if the gen_py wrapper is missing (e.g. fresh install on a new box),
we attempt lazy generation via ``gencache.EnsureModule``. If that also fails,
``flag_methods`` silently becomes a no-op; callers will fall back to the
original ``TypeError`` symptom on affected methods, but everything else still
works.
